# Voice-Controlled Human-Following Shopping Trolley

## Project Overview  
This project is a **Voice-Controlled Human-Following Shopping Trolley**, developed as part of our Mechatronics Engineering Higher Diploma Final Group Project. The trolley is designed to follow a user and respond to voice commands, showcasing advanced **computer vision, speech recognition, and hardware integration**.  

## Features  
- **Human Detection:** Utilizes the **YOLOv8s** pretrained model for full-body detection.  
- **Voice Control:** Recognizes commands such as **"Ready, Forward, Right, Left, Reverse"** to navigate.  
- **Hardware Integration:** Built with **ESP32, Camera, and Microphone modules**.  
- **Automatic Movement:** The trolley autonomously follows the user and moves based on commands.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (OpenCV, PyTorch, NumPy, SpeechRecognition)  
- **YOLOv8s** (Pretrained deep learning model for human detection)  
- **ESP32** (Hardware controller)  

## Project Outcome  
Successfully developed a **fully functional prototype**, demonstrating expertise in:  
✅ **Computer Vision**  
✅ **Voice Recognition**  
✅ **Embedded Systems**  
✅ **Hardware & Software Integration**  
✅ **Project Management**
